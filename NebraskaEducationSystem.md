## Data description

This Data set contains a multitude of information. There are 10 files in total, I am not sure if all of them are needed for analysis, but it depends on what questions someone would ask. Contained inside is information regarding Nebraska schools from the 2015-2016 year. There is information regarding Attendance Rate, Dropout Rates, Teacher information (general info, not specific personal info), and test scores around Math, Reading, Science, Writing. This information could be used to evaluate the success of Nebraska Schools, and determine which schools are more successful than others.

## Dataset Licensing Information

The Terms and Conditions page seems to be inactive on the main page, so no specific information regarding data usage could be found. I also checked the Privacy policy at "http://nep.education.ne.gov/privacy-policy/" and it gives a 404 error. There was nothing else I could find that would give me specific information in this general area. However, The Nebraska Department of Education is responsible for this data, which is a branch of the Nebraska Government, so I decided to go to the Nebraska.gov/policies page and found the following.
